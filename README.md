# Prepare for Battle
A website designed for the complex table top game; warhammer 40k. This website allows users to quickly, and efficiently 'prepare for battle'. It is a one stop shop for all the Rules they could need, as well as intuative UI to allow them to easily construct their army for game day. 

- Data Management:
Built an API for frontend-backend communication, used PostgreSQL for user data storage, and
integrated CSV data from Wahapedia for game rules and unit stats.

- Technologies:
HTML/CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, PDF-Lib, PostgreSQL

- Features:
User interface for managing armies and battle simulations, custom PDF generation using PDF-Lib, data
sourced from Wahapedia.

Please note, it will take 50 seconds to spin up when launched for the first time in awhile, as it is hosted on Render.
