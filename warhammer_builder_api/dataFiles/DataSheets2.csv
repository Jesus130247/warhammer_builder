Serendipitously, it also works well when searing through an enemy’s armour at close quarters, or, with a twist of its nozzle, can instead belch a tongue of roaring flame over the foe.

000000025|Kommandos|ORK|000000046|No right-thinking Ork trusts Kommandos. They sneak up on the enemy rather than charging in headlong, and have an unhealthy fascination with very big knives and their application to people’s backs, throats and guts. That said, having a band of Kommandos ambush the enemy mid-battle definitely has its uses.|Other|<b>Every model is equipped with:</b> slugga; choppa.||false|||||https://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/factions/orks/Kommandos|
000000026|Trukk|ORK|000000046|Trukks are ramshackle assemblages of hastily welded and riveted scrap metal bolted to overpowered engine blocks and rusty chassis. Rolling on fat, armoured tyres, they bear mobs of Orks into battle at high speed, shrugging off enemy fire by the simple expedient of shedding ablative panels and plates.|Dedicated Transports|<b>This model is equipped with:</b> big shoota; spiked wheels.|This model has a transport capacity of 12 <span class="tooltip00341" data-tooltip-content="#tooltip_content00341" data-tooltip-anchor="#tooltip_content00341"><span class="kwb">ORKS</span> <span class="kwb">INFANTRY</span></span> models.

000000028|Deffkoptas|ORK|000000046|Most Orks take a dim view of muckin’ about in the sky, and would much rather go to war with their feet firmly on the ground.

000000032|Wazbom Blastajet|ORK|000000046|Some Meks take to the skies in their own kustom aircraft.
