000000477|Pyrovores|TYR|000000020|Pyrovores exist to predigest biomass. The acids that drip from their maws are so corrosive they can melt adamantine. Meanwhile, their flame-spewing dorsal organisms can engulf entire squads of prey in roiling chemical fire. Even killing these bioforms is perilous, for their volatile innards can detonate upon death.|Other|<b>Every model is equipped with:</b> flamespurt; chitin-barbed limbs.||false|||||https://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/factions/tyranids/Pyrovores|
000000478|Haruspex|TYR|000000020|The infinite hunger of the Haruspex can see it consume an entire platoon of prey organisms in moments. Nothing escapes its yawning gullet and lashing tongue for long; its victims meet a horrible end as they are swallowed down to be gradually dissolved into raw biomass within the monster’s churning innards.|Other|<b>This model is equipped with:</b> grasping tongue; ravenous maw; shovelling claws.||false|||1-5|While this model has 1-5 wounds remaining, each time this model makes an attack, subtract 1 from the <a href="/wh40k10ed/the-rules/core-rules/#1.-Hit-Roll">Hit roll</a>.|https://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/factions/tyranids/Haruspex|
